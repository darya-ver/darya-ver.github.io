        <p class="lead mb-5">
          I am currently working on a Program Synthesis + HCI project that aims to build a
          synthesis tool for visual programming. The tool is aimed towards children who are 
          just learning to program for the first time. We are writing our synthesis tool in 
          <a href="https://emina.github.io/rosette/" target="_blank">Rosette</a>. This project is in collaboration with  
          <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bodik/" target="_blank">Ras Bodik</a> (professor), 
          <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/" target="_blank">Amy Ko</a> (professor), 
          and <a href="https://stefania11.github.io/" target="_blank">Stefania Druga</a> (PhD student).
        </p>

        <p class="lead mb-5">
          In my undergrad, I worked with <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~npolikarpova/" target="_blank">Nadia Polikarpova</a>
          on building a type-guided top-down enumerative synthesis tool for fully polymorphic and higher-order programs in Haskell. 
          It was built as an alternative search algorithm to <a href="http://hoogleplus.goto.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Hoogle+</a>, 
          a tool that allows users to provide a type signature and optional examples and get back a code snippet that consists of a 
          composition of Haskell library functions.
          With this research, I won 1st place at the 
          <a href="https://popl21.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2021-student-research-competition" target="_blank">2021 POPL Student Research Competition</a>
          with my <a href="./files/materials/popl21_src/abstract.pdf" target="_blank">3-page abstract</a> that I co-wrote with another undergrad, Daniel Wang.

        <p class="lead mb-5">
          Before that, I worked with <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jzhao/" target="_blank">Jishen Zhao</a> on 
          targetting the exploration of various software caching mechanisms in key-value store database on SSD using C++ and Linux.
          We further analyzed the access patterns of various applications and aimed to identify bottlenecks of Linux's mmap() system call.
          This research was part of the <a href="https://ersp.eng.ucsd.edu/home" target="_blank">Early Research Scholars Program</a>, a 
          research program designed for 2nd year CSE students to gain access to the Computer Science research. I presented my

          GRAD APP ADVICE

        <h2 class="mb-5">PhD Application Advice</h2>
        
            <p class="lead mb-5">
              When I was applying to PhD programs for the Fall 2021 cycle, I spent a lot of time trying to find examples of what a 
              Statement of Purpose (SOP) should look like. All I found were websites that alluded to what a statement should 
              look like without actually showing one. I felt that most, if not all, of the advice I got on how to write 
              one was from people in my life telling/showing me. I wanted to put my own application documents on my website
              so that people who were interested in applying to Computer Science PhD programs had an actual example to look
              at. 
            </p>

            <p class="lead mb-5">
              I wish the entire application process was more transparent. I find that there are many ways to make it more 
              accessible to people, and that departments have a ways to go in this area. I want to do what I can to bridge this 
              gap as much as possible. <b>If you would like to get more advice on applying to grad school, such as feedback on
              a statement or more information on how my application cycle went, please feel free to email me whenever. </b>
            </p>

            <h4 class="mb-5">My Application Materials:</h4>

            <p class="lead mb-5">
              <b><a href="./files/application_materials/sop.pdf" target="_blank">Statement of Purpose</a></b>

              <br>
              <b><a href="./files/application_materials/diversity.pdf" target="_blank">Diversity Statement</a></b>
              (only some schools required this)
            </p>



            <h4 class="mb-5">My Tips and Tricks:</h4>

            <p class="lead mb-5">
              Here are some general guidelines that I followed that I think made my SOP good, and most importantly, 
              <i>sound like me</i>. 

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Bolded sections.</b> Different kinds of people will be reading your statement for different 
                  reasons. Having your sections bolded means that it will be easier for the readers to skip to the
                  sections they are interested in.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  <b>Don't be afraid to get personal.</b> I originally had the impression that these statements should 
                  be entirely about research past, present, and future. And while that should be a focus, it shouldn't
                  be limited to that. It is, after all, a <i>personal</i> statement, so I think it's nice to have some 
                  tidbits about who you are as a person in addition to the technical stuff. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  <b>Signal from the start what you're interested in.</b> I think it's important to have your first 
                  paragraph say exactly what research area you're intested in and what you'd like to do with a PhD. I
                  don't think it's necessary to have a strong idea of what you'd like to do for either of those things, 
                  but having <i>some</i> idea is nice. It gives the reader a high-level summary of who your academic 
                  persona is. 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            
            <br>
            <h4 class="mb-5">Other Useful Links</h4>
            
            <p class="lead mb-5">There were some links I found that I think offer a nice perspective on this process as well. Here 
              are the ones I used: 

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b><a href="https://koronkevi.ch/posts/applying-to-grad-school.html" target="_blank">Paulette's Post About Applying.</a></b> 
                  This one offers a good overview of what is required to apply (in addition to SOP), with application timelines and advice
                  about each part of the application cycle. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  <b><a href="http://jxyzabc.blogspot.com/2008/08/cs-grad-school-part-1-deciding-to-apply.html" target="_blank">Jean Yang's Series of Posts.</a></b> 
                  Jean's blog is amazing. It offers a very real perspective on getting PhD, and made me feel much better about 
                  applying. Her posts are honest, funny, and offer a somewhat different example of what getting a PhD can look 
                  like (did you know that you can have a social life at the same time?). Definitely worth reading all her posts.

            <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow" target="_blank">PROW</a>'s 
            presubmit tool using <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html" target="_blank">GCOV</a>

            I am very passionate about <b>Climate Change Mitigation</b>. My first and second year of undergrad, I was part of 
            the <a href="https://iscucsd.wixsite.com/main/about" target="_blank">Inter Sustainability Council</a> at my university,
            where I helped develop a certificate to try to get more students involved in sustainability. Through the club, 
            I also volunteered for sustainability events on campus, such as Green Talks, in which invited speakers
            would come discuss different sustainability initiatives they were working on.
            During my fourth year of undergrad, I joined the 
              <a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/?ms=SunriseMovement" target="_blank">Sunrise Movement</a>'s
            local San Diego Hub. Through it, I am involved in supporting local communities who are affected by the Climate 
            Crisis, and support mutual-aid groups throughout the county.

            After becoming vegetarian in my Junior year of High School, I was forced to learn how to <b>cook</b> (plain tofu just didn't
            do it for me). One of my goals in life is to convince as many meat eaters as possible that vegetarian food isn't 
            gross, and that maybe it might even taste good! 
          </p>

          <p class="lead mb-5">
            While being stuck inside for months on end during the COVID-19 Pandemic, 
            I took up <b>herb gardening</b> (it made my food taste much better, but only last a couple months) and 
            <b>compositing</b> (very grateful my appartment had an outdoor patio so that my roommates didn't get mad at the smell).
            I also started reading again.
